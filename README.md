# Stempel :saxophone:
Batch rename your audio stems based on instrument-group!
---

My friend Xander, from Maas Audio, has a problem: 
Clients send me a ton of stems (the audio files that make up a song), but they are _unordered_.

**Request:** 
- Make me an algorithm that filters my files, and puts them into groups of type of instrument.


Currently a work in progress, but here's what it does now:

Instruments are grouped per letter, so for instance:
- A is Drums
- B is Bass
- F is Brass 
- etc, etc.
